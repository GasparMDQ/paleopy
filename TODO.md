### 1 December 2015

- [x] add "April-March" to the list of seasons available
- [ ] plot proxy(ies) location on the composite maps
- [ ] proxy dependent symbol
- [x] the proxy type (i.e. "Tree-ring", "speleotheme", "coral core") should
be an argument of the proxy class instance
- [ ] 1 map per year for proxy to be implemented (e.g. NZ region)
- [x] rename label "Kidson Type" to "New Zealand" in the heatmap and bar plots
- [ ] barplot to work for an individual proxy
- [ ] for the indices boxplot: add mean value, standard deviation and N (number of unique samples) in the plot
- [ ] composite netcdf output needs to include:
  - [ ] a variable containing years: number of analogs
  - [ ] a variable (nb of unique analog years, lat, lon)
  - [x] the composite anomalies (already there)
  - [x] the p-value

- [ ] need to work out a way to interactively extract "sudo-proxies" from the above
